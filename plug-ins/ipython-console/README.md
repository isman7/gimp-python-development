First ideas on modify the GIMP Python interpreter to be more interactive.

As for now, code from two sources has been grabbed: 

- [GIMP's Python Console](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gimp/-/tree/master/plug-ins/python/python-console) under GPLv3
- [SvenFestersen's GtkPyInterpreter](https://github.com/SvenFestersen/GtkPyInterpreter) under GPLv3
